## Code Assistant (Cody)

This is a little outside the current scope, but I discovred this and didn't want to lose it.

One of our use cases id to provide a developer assistant.  Ideally, we'd fine something along the lines of GitHub Copilot but it's not likely we'll achieve that level of performance using local open tooling.  However, there are some interesting tools that can help.  Previously we discovered Continue, a VS Code extension that enables use of a local LLM.  Here we'll look at [coLLaMA](https://github.com/iohub/coLLaMA), another VS Code extension that may provide an alternative in that space.
