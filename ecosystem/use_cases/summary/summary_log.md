>> This recipe is for Lobster Bisque from Git Food, a collection of favorite recipes managed on GitHub. The author fell in love with lobster bisque during a Thanksgiving visit to Connecticut in 2015 and couldn't find anything similar in the south. They tried various recipes and made some adjustments to create a rich, smooth, delicious bisque.
>> 
>> The recipe includes ingredients for both the bisque and garlic butter lobster meat & stock. To make the lobster stock, the author boils lobster tails in water with salt, then removes the meat and shells separately. The shells are returned to the pot to release their flavor into the liquid.
>> 
>> To make the bisque, the author melts butter and oil in a large pot and sautés onions, carrots, celery, thyme, tarragon, garlic, bouillon, salt, pepper, cayenne, and tomato paste. Flour is added to thicken the mixture, followed by white wine and lobster stock. The bisque is simmered until it thickens slightly, then blended until smooth. Heavy cream is added and the lobster meat is sautéed
