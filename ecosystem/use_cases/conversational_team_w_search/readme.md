# Conversational Team with Search

Establish a team of agents with the ability to search the web and use the results to answer questions.

In the first conversational team use case we used Microsoft's AutoGen to establish and run our agents.  Here we'll explore the [crewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) agent orchestration framework to establish and run our agents.  Keeping things simple, we'll simply adapt the example from the repo's readme to our debate test case.

## Setup

All I had to do was open a terminal and launch the LLM server:

```bash
python3 -m llama_cpp.server --model ./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_S.gguf
```

Then I just had to run the script:

```bash
python3 ./debate.py
```

## Results

Final Answer: In the year 2024, groundbreaking advancements have been made in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Generative AI and multimodal processing are two significant areas of progress. Generative AI has shown remarkable potential in creating human-like content, from generating art to composing music, bringing us closer to machines capable of understanding and processing sensory information like humans do. Multimodal processing, on the other hand, enables AI systems to analyze and understand multiple types of data simultaneously, such as speech, text, and images.

Moreover, open-source pretrained models have become increasingly popular among businesses, enabling them to leverage these advanced AI technologies more efficiently by combining them with their own data. This synergy leads to improved productivity, cost savings, and enhanced accuracy in various industries.

The positive impact of AI on the economy, job market, and human life cannot be overstated. According to recent studies, AI is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Furthermore, it's creating new jobs while transforming existing ones, leading to an estimated 2.3 million net new jobs in the US alone by 2025.

However, as we continue embracing these advancements, it is essential to address ethical and equitable concerns. We need to ensure that AI benefits humanity fairly and respects individual privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. Careful planning and implementation are necessary to maximize the potential rewards of AI while minimizing its challenges. The future holds great promise for this transformative technology, and with a thoughtful approach, we can reap its benefits while mitigating any potential negative consequences.

## Observations

- Setup using python-llama-cpp was incredibly simple.  I'm getting more happy with it every time I use it.
- The crewAI framework is very easy to use.  I was able to adapt the example from the readme to our debate test case with minimal effort.
- The results were reasonable.  I can see the first agent used the web search tool, but not the second.  It's not clear why it would do this.
- I like that crewAI builds upon LangChain and allows you to setup and configure things using the LangChain APIs.
- Although it certainly took a while to run, it wasn't too bad.  I'm curious what sort of performance we would see on a cloud instance with more available resources.
